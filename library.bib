abstract = {As the need for cloud services has been growing steadily, the size and energy consumption of datacenters have increased significantly over the past years. Due to economic and environmental constraints, energy efficiency in datacenters and greenhouse emissions have become a major concern. Renewable energy is widely seen as a promising solution to supply datacenters using local energy, without greenhouse gas emissions. However, intermittent power generation resulting from the use of renewable energy imposes a paradigm change in the way energy and computation activities are managed. On the one hand, service placement and scheduling may be used on the IT (Information Technologies) side to adapt to the available power. On the other hand, storage units may be used to lessen power generation variations. Existing literature and actual deployment mainly design optimization algorithms including the entire system (from Cloud service to electrical management, the latter often being neglected or simplified). Conversely to these approaches, we propose a solution where each side optimizes its own objectives, both interacting through a negotiation loop process to reach a common agreement. In this paper, we present DATAZERO, a project developing this idea to ensure high availability of IT services, avoiding unnecessary redundancies, under the constraints due to the intermittent nature of electrical and Cloud services flows.}

	doi = {10.1109/PDP.2017.24},
	abstract = {The fast growth of cloud computing considerably increases the energy consumption of cloud infrastructures, especially, data centers. To reduce brown energy consumption and carbon footprint, renewable energy such as solar/wind energy is considered recently to supply new green data centers. As renewable energy is intermittent and fluctuates from time to time, this paper considers two fundamental approaches for improving the usage of renewable energy in a small/medium-sized data center. One approach is based on opportunistic scheduling: more jobs are performed when renewable energy is available. The other approach relies on Energy Storage Devices (ESDs), which store renewable energy surplus at first and then, provide energy to the data center when renewable energy becomes unavailable. In this paper, we explore these two means to maximize the utilization of on-site renewable energy for small data centers. By using real-world job workload and solar energy traces, our experimental results show the energy consumption with varying battery size and solar panel dimensions for opportunistic scheduling or ESD-only solution. The results also demonstrate that opportunistic scheduling can reduce the demand for ESD capacity. Finally, we find an intermediate solution mixing both approaches in order to achieve a balance in all aspects, implying minimizing the renewable energy losses. It also saves brown energy consumption by up to 33\% compared to ESD-only solution.},

Renewable energy sources (RESs) can be a clean solution to meet this significant energy need, while protecting the environment. Each DC serves numerous customers for their data service demands, which are regarded as flexible loads. In this work, the price sensitivity and time sensitivity of a DC's users are first explored and a user-side demand response (DR) program is devised to improve the overall benefits of DC operation. Then, a Stackelberg game between a DC and its users is proposed. The upper-level model aims at maximizing the profit of the DC, in which the time-varying pricing of data services is optimized, while the lower-level model addresses the user's optimal decision for using data services while balancing their time and cost needs. The original bi-level optimization problem is then transformed into a single-level one using the Karush-Kuhn- Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions and strong duality theory, which enable the problem be solved efficiently. Finally, case studies are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method and the impacts of the time-varying data service price mechanism on the accommodation of generation from RESs.},

In this paper, we focus on the energy-efficient task scheduling problem in an Internet data center system powered by both conventional and renewable energies. An electricity cost minimization framework is built to intelligently schedule different tasks from different users on geo-distributed computing nodes. In such system, the indeterminate and intermittent renewable energy imposes huge scheduling challenges. To deal with the uncertain nature of renewable energy, a new flexible uncertainty model is developed. Specifically, reference distributions are introduced according to predictions and field measurements, and uncertainty sets are defined afterwards to confine the unstable renewable energy generations. The model allows the renewable energy generation distributions to fluctuate around their reference distributions. Chance constraint approximations and a robust optimization approach are proposed to first transform and then solve the energy-efficient task scheduling problem. Simulation experiments based on real-world data evaluate two different task scheduling strategies. Impacts of different parameters such as computing node number, task size, task number, electricity price traces and renewable energy generation traces are evaluated which indeed provide us some insights on how to build an energy-efficient Internet data center.},

	abstract = {Energy optimization with Quality-of-Service (QoS) constraint has become a timely and significant challenge for the cloud datacenters. In this paper, a hardware and software collaborative optimization strategy is implemented to minimize the energy cost while satisfying the time constraint of the cloud-computing datacenters. In the hardware aspect, a DVFS-capable CPU/GPU/FPGA heterogeneous cloud infrastructure is built. This infrastructure has high flexibility, and can adjust its hardware characteristics dynamically in terms of the software run-time contexts, so that a hardware platform which matches the software can be built. Based on this hardware platform, the cloud applications can be executed more efficiently with less energy cost. In the software aspect, the deadline-aware energy-efficient task scheduling algorithms are investigated. Different from the traditional approaches which search for the optimal scheduling solution by the heuristic approaches, a new scheduling approach based on the improved Mathematical Morphology (MM) algorithm is investigated in this paper. To evaluate the performance of our work, we calculated the energy cost of the Fourier transform (FT) and Gaussian elimination (GE) applications on the homogeneous and heterogeneous cloud computing platforms by applying the GA and MM algorithms, respectively. The results proved the MM algorithms running on the DVFS-capable heterogeneous cloud infrastructure could decrease the energy cost of the FT application and GE application respectively by 24.7\% and 37.8\%, if compared with the GA algorithm running on the DVFS-incapable homogeneous cloud infrastructure.},

abstract = {Climate change could potentially interrupt progress toward a world without hunger. A robust and coherent global pattern is discernible of the impacts of climate change on crop productivity that could have consequences for food availability. The stability of whole food systems may be at risk under climate change because of short-term variability in supply. However, the potential impact is less clear at regional scales, but it is likely that climate variability and change will exacerbate food insecurity in areas currently vulnerable to hunger and undernutrition. Likewise, it can be anticipated that food access and utilization will be affected indirectly via collateral effects on household and individual incomes, and food utilization could be impaired by loss of access to drinking water and damage to health. The evidence supports the need for considerable investment in adaptation and mitigation actions toward a “climate-smart food system” that is more resilient to climate change influences on food security.}}
