\begin{tabular}{l|p{12cm}}
    \hline
    Notation & Description \\\hline\hline
    $Q$ & Waiting queue of jobs (list)\\
    $j$ & Job index (int)\\
    $Wall_j$ & Walltime of job $j$ (s)\\
    $Wait_j$ & Waiting time of job $j$ (s)\\
    $Sb_j$ & Submission time of job $j$ (s)\\
    $Ex_j$ & Execution time of job $j$. It is how many seconds the job is executing from the beginning to now (s)\\
    $Dfl_j$ & Demanded flops of job $j$. This is unknown in advance (flop)\\
    $Dfl'_j$ & Estimated demanded flops of job $j$. The scheduler estimates it using Equation \ref{equ:estimated_job_size} (flop)\\
    $R_j$ & Number of servers requested by job $j$ (int) \\
    $Size_j$ & Estimated job $j$ size. It is the walltime multiplied by the number of servers requested (float)\\
    $bsld_j$ & Bounded Slowdown of job $j$ (float)\\
    $Gfl_j$ & Flops processed by the job $j$ (flops)\\
    $F'_{s}$ & Server speed for job size estimation (flops)\\
    $\epsilon_{u}$ & User execution time estimation error (float)\\
    $\Delta E_{bat}$ & Difference of target and calculated battery energy at the end of the time window (kWh)\\
    $E_{comp}$ & Energy to compensate (kWh)\\
